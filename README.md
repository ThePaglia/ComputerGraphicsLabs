# Setup
Search for cmake in the Windows Start menu and you should get the result CMake (cmake-gui).
In the first text input field "Where is the source code" put the directory where you downloaded the projects. You can browse to it using the button on the right.
Copy the value of the first field into the second one and add /build at the end of it.
Click Configure. You will be asked to create the missing build directory. Select yes.
Select your version of Visual Studio as the generator and press Finish. Wait for the output display to say -- Configuring done.
Press Generate. Once you see -- Generating done you can press Open Project to open the newly generated project in Visual Studio. You can now close CMake. You can also find the generated project in the build directory that was created in step 4.
